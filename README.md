# Farkle
The game of Farkle, allows for up to 6 players or solo against computer

This game of Farkle was rewritten from a Delphi 3 version of the game after the Delphi 3
environment was lost due to motherboard burn-out.  Subsequently, have restored the Delphi 3
environment so currently maintaining both versions.
Ths game allows for up to 6 players or solo against the computer (randomly selects a name
from an external file that can be extended if wanted).  The game A/I is pretty good, though
somewhat simplistic (saves all scoring die).
Game is dependent on the Dice component library (need it to open the forms in VS) along with
the GameStatistics library.
Game last editted/built in VS 2019.
